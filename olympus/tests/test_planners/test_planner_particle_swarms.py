# NOTE: something about this test seems to mess up any subsequent tests;

# Matteo: mmm I am not sure about this but it may be a pytest bug:
# https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5743
# The tests seem to run fine with the '-s' flag: pytest -s tests/test_planners
# The easiest solution/test would be to try switch off the pyswarm logging/messages, but I have not found a way to
# do this!
