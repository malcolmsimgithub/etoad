Need to create a script to measure samples


Will create atlas planner and olympus campaign.

Then, create workflow manager object
Args:
            -logger_settings: Path to the json file containing the logger settings
            -potentiostat_settings: Path to the json file containing the potentiostat settings
            -sampler_settings: Path to the json file containing the sampler settings
            -data_path: Path to the folder where data should be stored.
            -logfile: Optional - name of the logfile used.


-get recc params, turn into samples (list of dict)

- samples: List of samples (each one given as a dictionary)
- Each sample should be given as a dictionary with the keys "sample_name", "sample_location" and "workflow_path".


-Workflowmanager.submitsamples(samples)
-results(dict) = Workflowmanager.start_system()

- feed into optimizer for next loop and repeat
